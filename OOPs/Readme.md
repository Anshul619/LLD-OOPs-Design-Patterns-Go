# Object-Oriented Programming in GoLang
- Although Go has types and methods and allows an [object-oriented](https://github.com/Anshul619/LLD-OOPs-Design-Patterns/blob/main/OOP.md) style of programming, there is [no type hierarchy](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.j.p.heck/Courses/JAVAcourse/ch3/s1.html). 
- The concept of [interface](https://medium.com/@ubale.vikas9/interface-in-oops-6eae3731c242) in Go provides a different approach that is believed to be easy to use and in some ways more general. 
- There are also ways to embed types in other types to provide something analogous—but not identical—to subclassing.
- Also, the lack of a type hierarchy makes [objects](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP) in Go feel much more lightweight than in languages such as C++ or Java.

# Why is there no type inheritance in Go?
- Object-oriented programming involves too much discussion of the relationships between types, relationships that often could be derived automatically.
- Go takes a different approach.
- [Go types](TypesGo.md) can satisfy many [interfaces](Interfaces.md) at once, without the complexities of traditional multiple inheritance.
- [Interfaces](Interfaces.md) can be very lightweight with one or even zero methods can express a useful concept.
- Because there are no explicit relationships between [types](TypesGo.md) and [interfaces](Interfaces.md), there is no type hierarchy to manage or discuss.
